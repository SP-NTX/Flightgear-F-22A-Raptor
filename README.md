![Flightgear F22](/pic.png "My little Raptor, is he cute? :D")
To install it, download the zip, open the zip and rename the aircraft folder to F-22 (notice the Capital F)
Then copy that to C:\Program Files\FlightGear 2020.3\data\Aircraft Or the directory your installed aircrafts are

Missiles are in! see the aircraft help in game to learn how to use them!

Based primarily upon the raptor from the FGUK Hangar.
